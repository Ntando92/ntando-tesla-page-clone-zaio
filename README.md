Truly blessed to have come across an institution that goes by the name of 'Zaio Coding School'. This project, right here, was led and inspiredd by them. 
This is something I built through their project-simulated course: The Full stack web development course. Going through the step-by-step tutorials and following along in the pratical demonstrations of the tutorial videos I worked on this project and built it piece-by-piece. 

This is a clone of the front page of the Tesla site. The goal: to be able to replicate a popular website and maintain the standard of quality.

This taught me a lot about html and css and was a fine introduction into the world of coding.
